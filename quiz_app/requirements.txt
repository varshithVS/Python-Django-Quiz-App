### Additional Notes:

1. **Python Installation**: If the user doesn't have Python installed, direct them to [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and guide them through installation.
2. **Virtual Environment**: It's important to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies and avoid conflicts with other Python projects.
3. **Running the Development Server**: Users should access the app by navigating to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` in their browser.
